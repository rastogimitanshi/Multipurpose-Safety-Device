# Brief Description of the events that happen:
The device has two buttons with different functionalities. The first button only triggers a buzzer, to alarm the nearby people of the danger. The second button immediately clicks photographs in burst mode, calls the police station and multicasts SOS messages along with the location coordinates received from GPS, to all the emergency contacts stored in the local database. To further enhance the functionalities, we provided cloud support (Google Drive) for storing images which can later be retrieved by any person.
